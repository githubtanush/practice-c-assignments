// (a) Performing Short Division by Two with Remainder (For integer part)
// Take decimal number as dividend.
// Divide this number by 2 (2 is base of binary so divisor here).
// Store the remainder in an array (it will be either 0 or 1 because of divisor 2).
// Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.
